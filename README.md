 ### Fault Logger
This is a simple project I did for a company which uses a lot of electric motors in its processes.
The fault logger as its name suggests, is a platform where faults are recorded and stored for analysis
The fault logger keeps information about motors, users, usage and faults
It also has a dashboard which gives insights into the motor ratings, motor starters, and their faults for better decision making.
It is a flask app, with a database designed with sqlalchemy
The dashboard used was plotly-dash which was built on flask.
